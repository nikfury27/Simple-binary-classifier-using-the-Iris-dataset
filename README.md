# Simple Binary Classifier Using the Iris Dataset

## 📋 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to build a simple binary classification model using the Iris dataset. The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in machine learning, containing 150 samples of iris flowers with four features each: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. For this project, we simplify the task by creating a binary classification problem, focusing on distinguishing between two of the three species.

## 📂 Dataset
- **Source:** The Iris dataset is publicly available in the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
- **Classes:** Two classes (binary classification).
- **Features:** 4 (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width).

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib & Seaborn

## 📊 Model Building
- **Preprocessing:** Data cleaning, normalization, and splitting into training and test sets.
- **Algorithm:** Logistic Regression (can be extended to other classifiers).
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Precision, Recall, F1-Score.
